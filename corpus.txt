Ari is a young boy from a beautiful village located between Tirunelveli and Tenkasi. It’s Ari's usual activity to walk in the evening into the woods.Since Ari lives in a village, Ari seeks fresh air and new ideas from nature. Nature is the mother of invention, as many inventions stem from it. We don’t create anything by ourselves; we observe nature and derive good ideas from it. One day, while sitting on a rock surrounded by lime grasses, Ari watched a peahen with its chicks attempting to cross a pond. When it crossed, all the chicks flew, but unfortunately, one fell into the water and began swimming (they are naturally good swimmers). After some time, it couldn’t cross the pond, perhaps due to exhaustion, and started to drown. With a panicked heart, Ari jumped into the water, reached the spot, and somehow rescued the chick. Ari tried to blow air on it and performed CPR, but still couldn’t see any improvement. So, Ari decided to take it home. In Ari's small home, Ari's grandmother keeps some hens and roosters. One of the hens was with around seven chicks. Nestling under the Koonai (a pot-like structure used for retrieving water from wells, which is now repurposed as a home for hens and roosters in many villages), Ari placed the peafowl chick with them. The next morning, although the hen accepted the peafowl chick as one of its offspring, Ari thought there could be another mother counting her chicks. Thus, Ari took the chick to the shore of the pond from where it was found, hoping the mother would be there. Thankfully, Ari found the mother, but sadly, it did not come within a close distance. Therefore, Ari let the chick fly, Ari's mind filled with positive energy as usual!
